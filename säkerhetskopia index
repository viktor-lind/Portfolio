     <p style="color: white; text-align: left;"><br>My name is Viktor and i am currently studying for my bachelor degree in Interaction Design at
     Malmö Högskola. Right now, I am on my fourth semester with two to go. Since the field of Interaction Design is very broad
   we are given the opportunity to specialize in the area we find most interesting. For me it is programming. I studied one intro course of web development prior to Interaction Design which taught me the basics
of building websites, along with an intro course in C#. I have picked out several different projects I have worked in that I think represents me as an interaction designer. <br> <br><br>
<br>
I have always been fascinated by the technical evolution. Now I want to take part in making new technology more user friendly. <br><br>
       During our education, it is up to us students to decide what areas to focus on. This gives me a lot of opportunities to learn more
     about programming. In every project, I have had the role of lead developer. The main programming languages in the education is Java and JavaScript. Since web development
     is not a large part of my education, most of what I know about HTML, CSS and JavaScript is self-taught. I think of myself as an easy learner when it comes to programming and my goal is to work with front-end development.
     <br><br>Wellcome to my portfolio.

   <p class="modalText" style="color: black;">Oneplant is a semi-automatic indoor-irrigation system. The user takes care of the main plant while knowing that every other plant
     connected to the system will get the right amount of water. By monitoring the moisture levels in the soil we can determine if the plant needs water, thus eliminating
     the risk of forgetting to water or over water the plant. The hub-plant will signal when water level is getting to low. The sub-plants connected to the main plant will signal
     if they need additional water since every plant requires different amounts of water. The application will work as an assistant with additional information about each plant where the
     user can select which type of plant they have connected to the system. The application will not assist in the watering process since we want to keep the feeling of taking care
     of the plants and not make it fully automatic. Although it will warn if water levels are getting to low or the user forgets to water the plants.

                one would get when spinning a physical top. The player picks up the digital artifact by touching it. A swing-motion will
                initialize the rotation of the orbs surounding the artifact. By letting go of the screen the player can controll the artifact
                by tilting the mobile device. Ro is made for mobile devices with Unity 3D. The game was user tested at an early stage, the end result is based on those tests.<br>
                My main task was programming the game.

              This project is a redesign of the schedules displayed on the monitors located at the entrence of Malmö Högskola. Based on user research we found that the existing
              scheduled lacked functionality. It was hard to find the courses and in which classroom they were scheduled. So we did a total redesign shown in the image.
              I was responsable of connecting the time slots to the Kronox api, Kronox is the schedule client. The parser which is connected to the api is written in Java. <br><br>
              Skills gained:<br>
              Backend programming with Java<br>
              Got more familiar with Eclipse<br>
              Learned how to collect data from external API

  <p style="color: white; text-align: left;"><br>Besides the projects presented in my portfolio I have done a large number of smaller projects, in most of which I have had a lot of
    opportunities to practice programming. Both the Java and C# course i studied were primarily focused on backend programming which helped me a lot when switching
    over to JavaScript. During our second year, we switched the main programming language from Java to JavaScript.<br>
    Other than programming, i have experience with user testing and research.
